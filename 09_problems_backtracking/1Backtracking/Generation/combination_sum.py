https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/
Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations
of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the
frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150
combinations for the given input.

Overview
This is one of the problems in the series of combination sum.
They all can be solved with the same algorithm, i.e. backtracking.

Before tackling this problem, we would recommend one to start with another almost identical problem called Combination
Sum III, which is arguably easier and one can tweak the solution a bit to solve this problem.
https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/description/

For the sake of this article, we will present the backtracking algorithm.
Furthermore, we will list some other problems on LeetCode that one can solve with the same algorithm presented here.

Approach 1: Backtracking
Intuition
    As a reminder, backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational
    problems. The idea is that it incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate
    ("backtrack") as soon as it determines that this candidate cannot lead to a final solution.

Specifically, to our problem, we could incrementally build the combination, and once we find the current combination
is not valid, we backtrack and try another option.
To demonstrate the idea, we showcase how it works with a concrete example in the following graph:

For the given list of candidates [3, 4, 5] and a target sum 8, we start off from empty combination [] as indicated as
the root node in the above graph.
    Each node represents an action we take at a step, and within the node we also indicate the combination we build
    sofar.
    From top to down, at each level we descend, we add one more element into the current combination.
    The nodes marked in blue are the ones that could sum up to the target value, i.e. they are the desired combination
    solutions.
    The nodes marked in red are the ones that exceed the target value. Since all the candidates are positive value,
    there is no way we could bring the sum down to the target value, if we explore further.
    At any instant, we can only be at one of the nodes. When we backtrack, we are moving from a node to its parent node.

An important detail on choosing the next number for the combination is that we select the candidates in order, where
the total candidates are treated as a list.
Once a candidate is added into the current combination, we will not look back to all the previous candidates in the
next explorations.

To demonstrate the idea, let us zoom in a node (as we shown in the above graph) to see how we can choose the next
numbers.
    When we are at the node of [4], the precedent candidates are [3], and the candidates followed are [4, 5].
    We don't add the precedent numbers into the current node, since they would have been explored in the nodes in the a
    left part of the subtree, i.e. the node of [3].
    Even though we have already the element 4 in the current combination, we are giving the element another chance in
    the next exploration, since the combination can contain duplicate numbers.
    As a result, we would branch out in two directions, by adding the element 4 and 5 respectively into the current
    combination.

Algorithm

As one can see, the above backtracking algorithm is unfolded as a DFS (Depth-First Search) tree traversal, which is
often implemented with recursion.

Here we define a recursive function of backtrack(remain, comb, start) (in Python), which populates the combinations,
starting from the current combination (comb), the remaining sum to fulfill (remain) and the current cursor (start) to
the list of candidates.
Note that, the signature of the recursive function is slightly different in Java. But the idea remains the same.
    For the first base case of the recursive function, if the remain==0, i.e. we fulfill the desired target sum,
    therefore we can add the current combination to the final list.
    As another base case, if remain < 0, i.e. we exceed the target value, we will cease the exploration here.
    Other than the above two base cases, we would then continue to explore the sublist of candidates as [start ... n].
    For each of the candidate, we invoke the recursive function itself with updated parameters.
        Specifically, we add the current candidate into the combination.
        With the added candidate, we now have less sum to fulfill, i.e. remain - candidate.
        For the next exploration, still we start from the current cursor start.
        At the end of each exploration, we backtrack by popping out the candidate out of the combination.
