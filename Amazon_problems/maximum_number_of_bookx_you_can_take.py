https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-books-you-can-take/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=amazon-spring-23-high-frequencyExample 1:

Input: books = [8,5,2,7,9]
Output: 19
Explanation:
- Take 1 book from shelf 1.
- Take 2 books from shelf 2.
- Take 7 books from shelf 3.
- Take 9 books from shelf 4.
You have taken 19 books, so return 19.
It can be proven that 19 is the maximum number of books you can take.
